# NHL_Final Project

## Project Goal

Our goal is to determine if there is any correlation between our features(SHOT_DIST,CLOSE_DEF_DIST,Height(CD)..) selected and if the player is successful or in not making the basket(SHOT_RESULT). If there is a correlation, we would like to see what other features from different data not in our current set have a strong correlation to the shot_result output such as advanced player metrics. We selected this topic because we want to see what the potential outcomes are based on the data we have chosen. Furthermore, we feel that based on this data we can predict how certain players will perform by the spacing they create from the nearest defender.

## Questions we want to answer

Is there strong correlations between defender height and a shot being missed?
Is there a strong correlation for a player making a basket if the closest defender is more than 6 feet away from the shooter?
Is there a connection between being on the home team for star players to have a better shooting percentage?
Do we need to add more data to get a high accuracy score when using a machine learning model?


## Description of the data exploration phase of the project

## Description of the analysis phase of the project



# Technologies Used

## Source Control
Github will be the primary code hosting platform.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Excel will be used as an overview to the data. Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is using an 75/25 train-test split ratio. The training set was then fit into a Logistic Regression classifier.
